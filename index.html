				<p>
					The full stack developer definition is “someone who can work on both the back-end and front-end 
					of systems.” This means that they can develop fully fledged platforms (with databases, servers 
					and clients) which don’t need other applications to function. <br><br>
					
					At first, I didn’t know how to approach the question. I wanted to develop an answer that made 
					sense to anyone new to the arena of web development, but that still touched upon the finer details. 
					After all, maybe you are someone interested in making a career change and have repeatedly seen the 
					words “full-stack web developer” on every technical educational website and <b>job applications.</b>

			<h2>Understanding HTML</h2>
			
			<div class="content-classm">
				<p>
					HTML stands for (Hyper Text Markup Language). First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short 
					for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are 
					displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. 
					Every web page you see was written using one version of HTML. An update version of HTML is currently HTML 5.<br><br>

					HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser 
					would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic 
					structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of 
					HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance). <br><br>

					Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, 
					lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being 
					widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language. <br><br>
					<b>Note: It is mandatory to use (.html) extension after the file name.</b><br>

			<h2>Understanding CSS</h2>
			
			<div class="content-classm">
				<p>
					CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making 
					web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. <br><br>
					
					Using CSS, we can control the color 
					of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background 
					images or colors are used, layout designs, variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a 
					variety of other effects. CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides eye catching presentation 
					of an HTML document. Most Commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML. <br><br>

					Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December 1996. This version describes the CSS 
					language as well as a simple visual formatting model for all the HTML tags. CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 
					and builds on CSS1. This version adds support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts, 
					element positioning and tables. An update version of CSS is currently CSS3. <br><br>

					<b>Note: You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows:</b> <b style="color: rgb(221, 68, 8);">{Property: Value}</b>

			<h2>About Web Design</h2>
			
			<div div class="content-classr">
				<p>
					Web design is a process of designing and developing websites. Unlike web development, which 
					is mainly about functionality, web design includes aesthetics and is concerned about the 
					look-and-feel of the site as much as the functionality. If a website was a car, then web design 
					would include the chassis and interior design as much as the engine and the mechanics of the car. 
					The creative aspect of web design covers areas like web graphic design, user experience design, 
					interface design. <br><br>
					
					Web designers work with tools like Sketch, Figma, and Photoshop. The technical 
					aspect covers front-end and back-end development with tools and languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
					WordPress, WebFlow, etc. The practice of web design involves developing the interactions and visuals 
					that make good user experiences online. Building a site demands an eye for layout and usability, and 
					often requires both programming and design skills. <br>
